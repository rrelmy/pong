Just some javascript hacking

Some sort of pong game running in modern browsers (canvas 2d support)

Features
- almost working
- capable running with multiple balls

Keyboard input
- w, s  - move left player
- up, down - move right player
- esc, r - reset game
- pause, p - pause game

Todo
- fix js error on game reset
- fix ball bugging while player moves and ball is inside paddle
- finish retro font
- clean code
- compare with origin pong behaviour
- ball collisions

Idea
- 3d canvas
- cc music?
- multiple canvas to prevent full redraw
